WSDL:

- WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is an XML document that describes a web service.
- It is used in combination with SOAP and XML Schema to provide web services over the Internet.
- A client program connecting to a web service can read the WSDL to determine what functions are available on the server.

Enterprise WSDL:

- The Enterprise WSDL is strongly typed, 
    which means that it contains objects and fields with specific data types, such as int and string.
- The Enterprise WSDL document is for customers 
    who want to build an integration with their Salesforce organization only.
- Customers who use the enterprise WSDL document 
    must download and re-consume it whenever their organization makes a change to its custom objects or fields or whenever they want to use a different version of the API.

Partner WSDL:

- The Partner WSDL is loosely typed, 
    which means that you work with name-value pairs of field names and values instead of specific data types.
- This WSDL document is for customers, partners,and ISVs 
    who want to build an integration that can work across multiple Salesforce organizations, regardless of their custom objects or fields.
- The Partner WSDL is static, 
and hence does not change if modifications are made to an organizationâ€™s Salesforce configuration.
